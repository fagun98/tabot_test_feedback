# Feedback Verification Tasks

Here are the cases that need to be checked:

- [ ] Verify that the feedback generated for different quiz submissions is accurate based on the user’s answers.
- [ ] Edit the past 2-3 quizzes with all answers correct and set the current quiz to have all answers incorrect. Check how the feedback is generated, particularly focusing on the `area_of_improvement` and `suggestion` fields.
- [ ] Edit past quizzes with all answers incorrect and set the current quiz to have all answers correct. Verify the feedback similary as previous. (check `progress`).
- [ ] Confirm that feedback is personalized based on the user’s specific quiz performance rather than being generic.
- [ ] Check if the feedback adapts to the current quiz performance, rather than focusing solely on past performance. Ensure that suggestions for improvement are relevant to the current quiz context.
- [ ] Validate that the feedback reflects the user’s overall progress over time, highlighting improvements and areas that still require attention.
- [ ] Submit multiple quizzes with similar performance levels (e.g., consistent scores of 70%) and verify that the feedback is consistent and not overly repetitive.

### Main Objective
The main motive of these tasks is to check if the feedback is personalized and not generic, and if the feedback adapts to the current quiz rather than focusing solely on past performance.
